<!-- this is a subheadline -->
I'm a driven 20-something Somali-American,  who is dedicated to exploring the transformative power of data and its potential to benefit others. My focus is at the crossroads of data science, economics, and a deep-seated dedication to the public sector. I seek a career that merges these interests, employing my data analysis expertise to improve public services and initiatives. My goal is to use my skills not only in a professional capacity, but as a tool for societal contribution, aiming to make a significant impact on people's lives with informed, data-driven choices.
